## Installation instructions

We are in the middle of the migration towards Ansible for installation/deplopyment of OpenConext.

#### Ansible based installation
Installation Intructions for the new Ansible based OpenConext installation can be found in the Deploy repository of OpenConext: https://github.com/OpenConext/OpenConext-deploy

The Vagrant installation of the Ansible based installation scripts can be used by developers and for setting up a local demo OpenConext environment.

#### Non Ansible based installation
Installation Instructions an older version of OpenConext can be found at https://github.com/OpenConext/OpenConext-vm 

The non Ansible based installation is useful when setting up an OpenConext environment for a Proof-of-Concept and for installing OpenConext on a separate (non-local) system.

Installing the non Ansible based OpenConext requires a comprehensive understanding of Linux, Apache, PHP, and Shibboleth, as well as an understanding of how to take advantage of federated technologies.
